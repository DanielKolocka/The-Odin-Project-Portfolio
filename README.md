# The Odin Project Portfolio

[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) is a free, open-source curriculum that guides you from beginner to full-stack developer by aggregating the best resources and emphasizing hands-on projects to build practical skills. It focuses on teaching you how to think like a developer, preparing you to confidently learn new technologies on your own.

The path I have chosen to take is the [Full Stack Javascript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript) path after completing the [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations) prerequisite. 


Check out my projects below! There is a link to the GitHub Repository as well as the live preview.
